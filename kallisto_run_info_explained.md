## ðŸ“˜ Interpretation of Fields

| Field              | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
| `n_targets`        | Number of transcript targets in the index. Each corresponds to a unique transcript (e.g., from a FASTA file like `gencode.vM37.transcripts.fa`). |
| `n_bootstraps`     | Number of bootstrap replicates requested for quantification uncertainty (via `-b N`). |
| `n_processed`      | Total number of fragments (read pairs or single-end reads) processed by Kallisto. |
| `n_pseudoaligned`  | Number of fragments that were successfully pseudoaligned to at least one transcript. |
| `n_unique`         | Number of fragments pseudoaligned to **only one transcript**. |
| `p_pseudoaligned`  | Percentage of fragments that were pseudoaligned: `(n_pseudoaligned / n_processed) * 100`. |
| `p_unique`         | Percentage of fragments that were uniquely pseudoaligned: `(n_unique / n_processed) * 100`. |
| `kallisto_version` | Version of Kallisto used. |
| `index_version`    | Internal version of the index file format. |
| `k-mer length`     | Length of k-mers used to build the index (commonly 31). |
| `start_time`       | Time the run began. Useful for record-keeping and troubleshooting. |
| `call`             | Full command-line call used to run `kallisto quant`. Helps document parameters and file inputs. |
